# Functional-CSharp
A library that exposes often used types and monads used for functional programming to C#. 


# Disclaimer
I not close to being finished yet. I do not have much experience with functional programming, and certainly not with monads. 
I am making this library to get a sense of how commonly used patterns used in functional languages can be implented. It is also for me to explore functional paradigms in a language I am comfortable with. I might have stumbled and fumbled with my implentations, and they might not be 'correct', thus I do not recommend using this library for any real work.
